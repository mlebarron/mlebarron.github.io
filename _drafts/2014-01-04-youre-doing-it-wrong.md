### 10. You don't have a mobile site

That's right, this is the lowest thing on this list. At least mobile browsers do a decent job of scaling, zooming, and scrolling and let me still use your site, even though you are choosing to ignore the fact that mobile exists.

"show full site" is the only way to get functions done
popovers that prompt me to download, every time
javascript scrolling
making it look like an app, it's not an app, embrace that
lots of code, bad code, javascript
breaking native functions (swipe to go back)
disabling save password
